Python - Classes and Objects
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language: classes, instances, private/public fields/attributes, methods/functions, __str__ to print, comparator methods (!= __ne__, == __eq__, >= __ge__, > __gt__, < __lt__, <= __lt__)

Description of what each file shows:
test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
Files that start with:
create empty square class and build on this class in next files
add private attribute size
validate size is int and >= 0 else TypeError
define public method area with ValueError if size < 0
define getter and setter for size
define print method to print square with "#"'s
define private position attribute to use in printing offsets
100 - Singly Linked List - create head, insert nodes, print with __str__
101 - define __str__ method to print square if called with print()
102 - define comparator methods
103 - recreate code to match Bytecode (re: class, import, private attribute)
