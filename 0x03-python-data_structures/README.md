Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language: lists, tuples

Description of what each file shows:
main_test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
lists.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes for #13
Files that start with:
prints all integers of a list
function that retrieves an element from a list like on
function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)
function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
function that removes all characters c and C from a string
function that prints a matrix of integers
function that adds 2 tuples
function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
function that finds the biggest integer of a list
function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list
function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
switch value of a and b
